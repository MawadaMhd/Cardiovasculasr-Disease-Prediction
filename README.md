## Projects
### **[Cardiovascular Disease Classification](https://github.com/MawadaMhd/Classification/tree/main/Cardiovascular%20Disease%20Predictive%20Modelling)**
  
**Description:** This project aimed to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in individuals based on various risk factors and medical history.

**Algorithms Used:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, KNeighbors Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, SVC.

**Results:** Random Forest Classifier (Accuracy: 98%, F1 Score (0.98, 0.99)

### **[Tumor Benign Malignent Classification](https://github.com/MawadaMhd/Classification/tree/main/Tumors%20BenignMalignant%20Classification%2096)**

**Description:** This project aimed to create a machine learning algorithm that can differentiate between benign and malignant tumors for early detection and treatment planning.

**Algorithms Used:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, KNeighbors Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, SVC.

**Results:** KNN Classifier (Accuracy: 99%, F1 Score (0.98, 0.99)
